# Credit Card Approval Prediction

## Overview
This project aims to predict credit card approvals using machine learning techniques. By analyzing historical data, we build predictive models to automate the credit card approval process, saving time and reducing human errors.

## Motivation
The banking industry receives numerous credit card applications, which can be time-consuming to process manually. Automating this process using machine learning can streamline operations and improve efficiency.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository ([Credit Approval Dataset](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/credit+approval)). It contains attributes such as income, age, employment status, and other relevant factors for predicting credit card approvals.

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**: 
   - Handle missing values.
   - Encode categorical variables.
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: 
   - Explore relationships between variables.
   - Identify important features for prediction.
3. **Model Building**:
   - Utilize machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, random forest, and gradient boosting classifier.
   - Evaluate model performance using accuracy and other relevant metrics.
4. **Model Optimization**:
   - Fine-tune hyperparameters using techniques like grid search to improve model performance.
   
## Libraries Used
- pandas
- numpy
- sklearn
- seaborn
- matplotlib

## Results
- Achieved a model accuracy of 90.44% using logistic regression and random forest.
- Explored opportunities for further improvement through hyperparameter tuning.

## Future Work
- Explore additional machine learning algorithms.
- Gather more data to improve model generalization.
- Deploy the model for real-time credit card approval predictions.
